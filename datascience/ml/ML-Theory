# THE LECTURES #

    Taught by Feynman Prize winner Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa.

    The fundamental concepts and techniques are explained in detail. The focus of the lectures is real understanding, not just "knowing."

    Lectures use incremental viewgraphs (2853 in total) to simulate the pace of blackboard teaching.
